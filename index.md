#### Topic and aims

Once you have completed this workshop on computational thinking, you should be able to:

- Identify the steps involved in computational thinking
- Break a problem down into more manageable pieces
- Develop an algorithm to solve a problem
- Use abstraction to make the algorithm re-usable

#### Audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers at all career stages who want to understand both the uses and the building blocks of computational thinking. The workshop will not teach you computer programming, but rather the thought processes you need to follow once you do begin to program. 

#### Prerequisites

A pen and paper is all you will need to cmplete this workshop. All the practice exercises can be done without a computer.

#### Assumed knowledge

No prior knowledge is assumed.
