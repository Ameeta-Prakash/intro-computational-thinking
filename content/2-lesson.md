While thinking computationally is a prerequisite for programming, programming and computational thinking are not the same thing.

Programming instructs a computer to carry out a sequence of steps in a certain order. Computational thinking is the process that helps you arrive at what those steps should be, i.e. working out what you plan to tell the computer to do.

Subconsciously, we practise computational thinking every day of our lives. 

For example, if you agree to meet your friends somewhere you have never been before, you would probably plan your route before you step out of your house. You might consider the routes available and which route is ‘best’ - this might be the route that is the shortest, the quickest, or the one which goes past your favourite shop on the way. You'd then follow the step-by-step directions to get there. In this case, the planning part is like computational thinking, and following the directions is like programming.

Being able to turn a complex problem into one we can easily understand is a skill that is extremely useful. In fact, it's a skill you already have and probably use every day.

For example, it might be that you need to decide what to do with your group of friends. If all of you like different things, you would need to decide:

what you could do
where you could go
who wants to do what
what you have previously done that has been a success in the past
how much money you have and the cost of any of the options
what the weather might be doing
how much time you have
From this information, you and your friends could decide more easily where to go and what to do – in order to keep most of your friends happy. You could also use a computer to help you to collect and analyse the data to devise the best solution to the problem, both now and if it arose again in the future, if you wished.
