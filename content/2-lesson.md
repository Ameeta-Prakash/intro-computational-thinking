While thinking computationally is a prerequisite for programming, programming and computational thinking are not the same thing.

Computers are precise, and computing instructions must be clear and unambiguous, as the computer cannot think - it can only follow orders. Luckily, computers work very quickly. Unlike humans, they do not get bored or distracted, and will carry out the same tedious, repetitive tasks over and over again without making mistakes.

#### Computational thinking in our daily lives

Subconsciously, we practise computational thinking every day of our lives. As Jeannette Wing stated: 

*"Computational thinking describes the mental activity in formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. **The solution can be carried out by a human or machine**."*

Every time we need to plan to do something, we use some of the steps of computational thinking such as problem breakdown, pattern recognition and developing algorithms. 

Project managers use computational thinking to plan complex activities. 

Epidemiologists use it to identify patterns they can use to predict how a disease outbreak will spread. 

Parents use it to plot how they will juggle parenting, work and childcare.

#### Example: Planning a meeting

Suppose we have to arrange a face-to-face meeting in city A. Some of the meeting attendees will need to travel to get there from cities B and C, and then transfer to the meeting venue from whatever form of transport they have used to get to city A. In order to arrange the successful transport of all attendees, the problem must first be broken down. Some of the high level factors will be:

- Who is attending, and from where?
- What forms of transport will they use to get to city A?
- What are the transport links to the venue from the airport, railway terminus or bus station?

Time and cost constraints would also need to be considered, as would any potential need for disability support. The diagram can be expanded to fit more and more in as issues are progressively identified.

#### Breaking problems down

When trying to solve problems, it is essential to break them down into their constituent parts. 

Pasting sticky notes on a wall, or creating a structure diagram on a whiteboard can help with this. (A structure diagram can be described as a conceptual modelling tool to list and organise the different steps in a process.)

In this case, the planning part uses computational thinking to break the problem down. Pattern recognition is involved - people know how to look up travel information, and can use that knowledge to devise solutions. All of the steps chosen to solve the problem, i.e. the means of getting the different attendees to the meeting, comprise the programming algorithm created to solve the problem after it has been broken down into manageable parts. 

Should another meeting be needed in the future, with different attendees, the process above could be abstracted and re-used to solve the issue. 

#### Structure diagrams

Structure diagrams allow you to plan your problem breakdown visually. At the top should be the objective, and the steps underneath should start with high level considerations. These high level considerations can then be broken down into smaller and smaller steps.

In the example below, a group of five people have survived a major nuclear accident. They do not know how many other people might have survived, or what kinds of conditions they are facing. They have to work out how they are going to survive. The diagram is the start of their thinking about their immediate needs.

### Practice

Imagine you have invited three friends to your house for lunch. Draw a structure diagram of all the things you would need to consider in your plan to make this happen, such as location, seating, recipes, drinks, table settings and so on.
