While thinking computationally is a prerequisite for programming, programming and computational thinking are not the same thing.

Programming instructs a computer to carry out a sequence of steps in a certain order. Computational thinking is the process that helps you arrive at what those steps should be, i.e. working out what you plan to tell the computer to do.

Subconsciously, we practise computational thinking every day of our lives. As the BBC definition stated: 

*"Computational thinking ... allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions in a way that **a computer, a human, or both, can understand**."*

Every time, we need to plan to do something, we use some of the steps of computational thinking such as problem breakdown, pattern matching and developing algorithms. 

Suppose we have to arrange a meeting in city A. Some of the meeting attendees will need to travel to get there, and then transfer to the meeting venue from whatever form of transport they have used for their travel. In order to arrange the successful transport of all attendees, the problem must first be broken down:

- Who is attending?
- What forms of transport will they use to get to city A?
- What are the transport links to the venue from the airport, railway terminus or bus station?
- How much time needs to be factored in for transit?
- Does cost need to be considered?
- Do any of the attendees require disbility support?

In this case, the planning part uses computational thinking to break the problem down. Pattern matching is involved - people have travelled before, and use that knowledge to devise solutions. All of the steps chosen to solve the problem, i.e. to get the different attendees to the meeting, are the programming algorithm that has been created to solve the problem after breaking it down. 

Should another meeting be needed in the future, with different attendees, the process above could be abstracted and re-used to solve the issue.
