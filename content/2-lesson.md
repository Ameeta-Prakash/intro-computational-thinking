While thinking computationally is a prerequisite for programming, programming and computational thinking are not the same thing.

Computers are precise, and computing instructions must be clear and unambiguous. Luckily, computers work very quickly. Unlike humans, they do not get bored or distracted, and will carry out the same tedious, repetitive tasks over and over again without making mistakes.

#### Computational thinking in our daily lives

Subconsciously, we practise computational thinking every day of our lives. As Jeannette Wing stated: 

*"Computational thinking describes the mental activity in formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. **The solution can be carried out by a human or machine**."*

Every time we need to plan to do something, we use some of the steps of computational thinking such as problem breakdown, pattern matching and developing algorithms. 

Suppose we have to arrange a face to face meeting in city A. Some of the meeting attendees will need to travel to get there from cities B and C, and then transfer to the meeting venue from whatever form of transport they have used for their travel to city A. In order to arrange the successful transport of all attendees, the problem must first be broken down. Some of the factors will be:

- Who is attending, and from where?
- What forms of transport will they use to get to city A?
- What are the transport links to the venue from the airport, railway terminus or bus station?
- How much time needs to be factored in for transit?
- Does the cost of different local transport options need to be considered?

It is helpful to break the problem down into its constituent parts. Pasting sticky notes on a wall, or creating a chart on a whiteboard can help with this. 
In this case, the planning part uses computational thinking to break the problem down. Pattern matching is involved - people know where to find travel information, and can use that knowledge to devise solutions. All of the steps chosen to solve the problem, i.e. the means of getting the different attendees to the meeting, comprise the programming algorithm that has been created to solve the problem after it has been broken down. 

Should another meeting be needed in the future, with different attendees, the process above could be abstracted and re-used to solve the issue.

### Practice

Imagine you have invited three friends to your house for a lunch. Draw a chart of all the things you would need to consider in your plan to make this happen, such as location, seating, recipes, drinks, table settings and so on.
