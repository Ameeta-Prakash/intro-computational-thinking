Pseudocode

#### Breaking problems down

When trying to solve problems, it is essential to break them down into their constituent parts. 

Pasting sticky notes on a wall, or creating a structure diagram on a whiteboard can both help to visualise the necessary steps. 

Pseudocode is another useful mechanism.

### Practice

Imagine you are designing a something. Create some pseudocode to illustrate the steps.
