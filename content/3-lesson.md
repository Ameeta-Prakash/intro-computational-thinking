Decomposition is really important in programming. The computer must be told precisely what to do, and in what order, so a problem you are using automation to solve must be broken down and each section coded appropriately.

Suppose we want to find the most commonly used ten words in a text. How would we go about that?

There are many ways to do it. This is one way. We could first

- save the text as a text file (this will elimiate all "smart" formatting created by programs like Word)
- remove all the punctuation
- change the case of all the words to lower case 
- remove all the `new line` characters
- sort the file by word so that all instaces of a word appear sequentially
- count the instances of each word
- sort by count, with largest first
- output the first ten words

Job done.
