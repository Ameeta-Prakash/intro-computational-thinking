Decomposition is really important in programming. The computer must be told precisely what to do, and in what order, so a problem you are using automation to solve must be broken down and each section coded appropriately.

Suppose we want to find the most commonly used ten words in a text. How would we go about that?

#### Linear code

There are many ways to do it. This is one way, where all the commands are run in a linear sequence. We could first

{% include figure.html img="word-count.png" alt="counting words in a text" caption="Counting words in a text" width="75%" %}

Job done.

#### Branching code

However, programming rarely works in a linear fashion. Usually, code includes branching so that differwent pathways can be taken depending on the conditions being met or not met, e.g. a Yes/No decision.
