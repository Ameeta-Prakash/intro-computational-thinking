*Decomposition* is really important in programming. The computer must be told precisely what to do, and in what order, so a problem you are solving must be broken down into parts and each section coded appropriately.

Suppose we want to find the most commonly used ten words in a text. How would we go about that?

#### Linear code

There are many ways to do this task. This is one way, where all the commands are run in a linear sequence, e.g.,

{% include figure.html img="count-words.png" alt="counting words in a text" caption="Counting words in a text" width="60%" %}

Job done.

Each part of the sequence would need to be individually coded. The good thing is that programmers can adapt code that others have already used to do similar tasks, such as identifying letter, number or word frequency. This is where the computational thinking skill of *pattern matching* comes in - identifying similar code that can be used or adapted to the specific problem you have.

#### Branching code

Programming rarely works in such a linear fashion. Code generally includes branching so that different pathways can be taken, depending on conditions being met or not met, e.g., different responses to a `Yes/No` decision, as in the example here.

{% include figure.html img="workflow.png" alt="Branching code" caption="Branching code" width="90%" %}

#### Learning to program

This lesson is not intended to teach you coding, but to help you prepare to learn to code by first understanding the process that coders use to break complex problems down into actionable sections. 

Links on sites that teach coding and other resources on computational thinking are listed in the following section.
