Computational thinking is an essential prerequisite for anyone wanting to learn to write computer code.

There are many different definitions of computational thinking. However, it can be described as a set of strategies to enable people to solve problems, especially complex ones.

Professor Jeannette Wing (1) brought computational thinking to prominence in a 2006 paper. She says, *"Informally, computational thinking describes the mental activity in formulating a problem to admit a computational solution. The solution can be carried out by a human or machine, or more generally, by combinations of humans and machines."*

The BBC (2) provides a good definition:

*"Computers can be used to help us solve problems. However, before a problem can be tackled, the problem itself and the ways in which it could be solved need to be understood. Computational thinking allows us to do this ... (it) allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions. We can then present these solutions in a way that a computer, a human, or both, can understand."*

There are four essential components of computational thinking:

- **Decomposition** – breaking a problem down into more manageable parts so that a solution can be found for each
- **Pattern recognition** – looking for similarities with other problems 
- **Algorithms** – developing a step-by-step solution to the problem
- **Abstraction** – abstracting the important detail that can make a solution reusable

In the following exercise, we will see each step at work.
