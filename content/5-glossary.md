| **Term** | **Meaning** |

| **Abstraction** | Reducing a problem's complexity by focusing solely on the most important parts is called abstraction. Abstraction involves generalising from specific instances to things that can be applied more broadly. For example, a model is an abstract representation of a real system, and models can be used for testing and planning in a way that real world systems cannot. The use of variables in algebra (e.g., *`x=y/2`*) or in computer programming is another example of abstraction. |
| **Algorithm** | An algorithm is a series of steps that must be followed in a specific order to solve a problem. When you plan a route home from work or cook a recipe, you are executing an algorithm. Presenting a solution to a problem in the form of an algorithm makes a process reproducible by others. |
| **Automation** |  Automation often involves using a program or computer application to perform repetitive tasks or calculations. By making processes reproducible, algorithms are a key enabler of automation. |
| **Coding** | Another word for computer programming, i.e. writing computer code that instructs a computer in what to do. |
| **Decomposition** | Solving a complex problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. |
| **Pattern recognition** | In computational thinking, identifying patterns or connections across the different parts of a larger problem is one of the keys to solving it. |
| **Programming** | Another word for coding. |
| **Use of Data** | Many kinds of data practices involve computational thinking. Collecting data, analysing data, and visualising data can help you break a problem down. |
