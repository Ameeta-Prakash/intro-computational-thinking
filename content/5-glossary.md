| **Term** | **Meaning** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Abstraction** | Reducing the complexity of a problem by focusing on its most important features is called abstraction. It often involves generalizing from specific instances to something that can be applied more broadly. The use of variables to represent unknown quantities in algebra is an important example of abstraction. A model is an abstract representation of a real system. Models often use mathematical and computational ideas to express relationships between entities of interest. A model is an example of abstraction |
| **Algorithm** | An algorithm is a sequence of steps that must be followed in a specific order to solve a problem. When you follow the instructions in a recipe to bake a cake, you are, in essence, executing an algorithm. By expressing the solution to a problem in the form of an algorithm, you make the process reproducible. |
| **Automation** |  Automation often involves using a program or computer application to perform repetitive tasks or calculations. By making processes reproducible, algorithms are a key enabler of automation. |
| **Coding** | Another word for computer programming, i.e. writing computer code that instructs a computer in what to do. |
| **Decomposition** | Solving a complex problem by breaking it up into smaller, more manageable tasks is called decomposition. |
| **Pattern matching** |  Regular expressions |
| **Programming** | Another word for coding. |
| **Use of Data** | All sorts of data practices involve computational thinking. Collecting data, analysing data, and representing data in different ways all help you think about a problem. |
